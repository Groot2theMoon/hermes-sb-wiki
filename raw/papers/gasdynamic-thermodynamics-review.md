Conservation of energy

need to balance
For a closed system:
𝑑𝐸

Energy (𝐸) of a fluid element consists of:
𝑒– internal energy 
𝑈2
2 - kinetic energy
𝑔𝑧– potential energy
Energies per unit mass
Rate of change in energy of fluid as it flows = rate of heat added to the 
control volume from surrounding + rate of work done on a fluid inside 
control volume

Perfect (ideal) gas
Perfect (ideal) gas – a gas in which which intermolecular forces are neglected
Equation of state for perfect gas:
𝑝𝑉= 𝑛𝑅𝑇,
where 
𝑝– pressure
𝑉– volume of the system
𝑛– amount of substance of gas (number of moles) 
𝑅– ideal (universal) gas constant (𝑅= 8.314
𝐽
mol∙𝐾) – same for all gasses
𝑇– temperature 
𝑛= 𝑚
𝑀,
𝑚– mass of the gas
𝑀– molar mass
Hence
𝑝𝑉= 𝑚𝑅𝑠𝑇,
𝑅𝑠– specific gas constant (for air 𝑅𝑠= 287
𝐽
𝑘𝑔∙𝐾)
𝑅𝑠=
𝑅
𝑀


## Page 13

Perfect gas
Other forms of the equation of state for perfect gas:
Diving by the mass of the gas we get:
𝑝𝜗= 𝑅𝑠𝑇,
where 
𝜗– specific volume
Since 𝜌= 1/𝜗
𝑝= 𝜌𝑅𝑠𝑇

Internal energy and enthalpy
For an equilibrium system of a real gas as well as for a chemically reacting mixture of perfect gases internal 
energy is a function of both temperature and volume.
𝑒– specific internal energy (per unit mass)
ℎ= 𝑒+ 𝑝𝜗– enthalpy per unit mass
𝑒= 𝑒𝑇, 𝜗
ℎ= ℎ𝑇, 𝑝
For thermally perfect gas (no chemical reactions and no intermolecular forces):
𝑒= 𝑒𝑇
ℎ= ℎ𝑇
𝑑𝑒= 𝑐𝑣𝑑𝑇
𝑑ℎ= 𝑐𝑝𝑑𝑇
𝑐𝑣– specific heat at constant volume
𝑐𝑝–specific heat at constant pressure


## Page 16

Internal energy and enthalpy
For calorically perfect gas (gas where specific heats are constant)
𝑒= 𝑐𝑣𝑇
ℎ= 𝑐𝑝𝑇
It can be assumed that 𝑒= ℎ= 0 at 𝑇= 0
Using specific internal energy and enthalpy we can get the following relation: 
ℎ−𝑒= 𝑐𝑝𝑇−𝑐𝑣𝑇
𝑒+ 𝑝𝜗−𝑒= 𝑇(𝑐𝑝−𝑐𝑣)
𝑝𝜗= 𝑇(𝑐𝑝−𝑐𝑣)
Recall 𝑝= 𝜌𝑅𝑠𝑇
𝑅𝑠= 𝑐𝑝−𝑐𝑣
Holds for calorically perfect and thermally perfect gasses 
Does not hold for chemically reacting and real gasses 


## Page 17

Internal energy and enthalpy
We can get two useful forms of 𝑅𝑠= 𝑐𝑝−𝑐𝑣
1) Dividing by 𝑐𝑝
1 −𝑐𝑣
𝑐𝑝

𝑐𝑝
γ ≡
𝑐𝑣
𝑐𝑝– specific heat ratio
γ = 1.4 for air
1 −γ = 𝑅𝑠
𝑐𝑝
Hence, 
𝑐𝑝= γ𝑅𝑠
γ −1

For practical example 1 calculate the total internal energy of air stored in tanks at maximum pressure

From practical example 1 we found 𝑚= 1408.06 𝑘𝑔
𝐸= 𝑚𝑒= 1408.06 × 210,335.125 ≈296,164,476.108 𝐽

First law of thermodynamics
𝑊𝑖𝑛

𝑞𝑖𝑛
𝑞𝑜𝑢𝑡
𝑞– heat
𝑊– work
The change in internal energy of a system is 
equal to the heat added to the system 
minus the work done by
the system.
Conservation of Energy: The total energy of an isolated system 
remains constant; it just transforms.
𝑒
𝑒– energy stored inside the system
𝑑𝑞= 𝑑𝑒+ 𝑑𝑊


## Page 21

First law of thermodynamics
Adiabatic process – a process in which no heat is added to the system 
Reversible process – a process in which no dissipative phenomena occur (no effects of viscosity, thermal 
conductivity, and no mass diffusion)
Isentropic process – a process which is both adiabatic and reversible
For a reversible process
𝑑𝑊= −𝑝𝑑𝜗
𝑑𝜗– incremental change in specific volume due to a displacement of the boundary of the system
Hence
𝑑𝑞−𝑝𝑑𝜗= 𝑑𝑒

The first law alone does not determine the direction of heat flow
First law of thermodynamics
𝛿𝑄= 𝑑𝑒+ 𝛿𝑊
Since 𝛿𝑊= 0
𝑑𝑒= 𝛿𝑄
For the system of two plates:
𝑑𝑒= 𝑑𝑒1 + 𝑑𝑒2 = 0
So
𝛿𝑄1 + 𝛿𝑄2 = 0
This allows two scenarios:
Case 1:
𝛿𝑄1 < 0, 𝛿𝑄2> 0
Case 2:
𝛿𝑄1 > 0, 𝛿𝑄2< 0
Heat flows from hot plate to 
cold plate
Heat flows from cold plate to 
hot plate
Both cases satisfy energy conservation


## Page 23

Second law of thermodynamics
The second law of thermodynamics tells in which direction the process takes place
The process will proceed in a direction such that the entropy (𝑠) of the system + surroundings always 
increases (or stays the same)

For adiabatic process 𝜕𝑞= 0
